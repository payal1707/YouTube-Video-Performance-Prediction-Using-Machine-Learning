# YouTube Video Views Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts YouTube video views using engagement metrics such as likes, comments, video duration, and upload time. A Linear Regression model is used for prediction.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset Features
- likes
- comments
- duration_minutes
- upload_hour
- views (target)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Evaluation
6. Prediction

## 📈 Model Performance
- R² Score: High accuracy on sample data
- Mean Squared Error used for evaluation
